/**
 * Mongoose model for tracking credit purchase transactions in the application.
 *
 * This model represents a credit purchase transaction, storing details about
 * the purchase made through Stripe. Each transaction is linked to a user (buyer)
 * and records the amount paid, credits purchased, and the specific plan chosen.
 *
 * Used in:
 * - Credit purchase workflow (Checkout component)
 * - Stripe webhook handling for successful payments
 * - User credit balance updates
