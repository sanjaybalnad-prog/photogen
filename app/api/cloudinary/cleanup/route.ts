/**
 * @route GET /api/cloudinary/cleanup
 *
 * Deletes garbage (orphaned) images from Cloudinary.
 *
 * An image is considered garbage if:
 * - It exists in the configured Cloudinary folder.
 * - It is NOT referenced by any document in the `Image` collection in the database.
 *
 * Reason:
 * - Users may upload an image but not complete the action (e.g., form submission),
 *   which results in the image being stored in Cloudinary but not tracked in the DB.
 * - These orphaned images waste cloud storage and should be periodically cleaned up.
 *
 * Cleanup Criteria:
 * - The image must be older than 5 minutes (to allow for delayed saves).
 * - It must not exist in the `Image` model (checked using its `public_id`).
 *
 * Recommended Usage:
 * - Run this route every 5 minutes using a CRON job, GitHub Actions, or a serverless scheduler.
 * - Increase frequency for higher-traffic applications.
